    title: Effective Storytelling with Data Visualization
    description: >-
      Technology has enabled email marketers to collect a mass amount of data about our subscribers, but having all of this data doesn’t make it easier to communicate - it makes it harder to know what’s relevant. Being able to visualize that data to tell a story, however, can not only provide an informative experience, it can also help drive the actions we want our subscribers to take.

      In this session, we will walk through various datasets to identify stories that can provide value to our subscribers as well as explore the science of how people perceive data to remove irrelevant information to assist in better understanding. We will leverage principles of visual perception to design appropriate data visualizations for our emails, as well review code snippets that will help build these experiences using HTML, CSS, and even animation as a progressive enhancement.

    title: Demystifying APIs for Better Email Programs
    description: >-
      When a project calls for a custom feature that stretches beyond what an ESP can handle, email marketers are confronted with a difficult choice: Pay additional money or use an API. For many, APIs are monstrous beasts that leave them feeling intimidated and forcing them to spend big money in the process. But APIs don’t have to be scary. In fact, APIs can transform your campaigns from static and predictable into dynamic, unexpected, and valuable. Walk through a customer journey and see how APIs can be put to work to enhance the subscriber experience, with plenty of tips on API basics, tools, and usage to get over the fear of using APIs.

        title: Headless architecture and the future of websites
        description: >-
            Users are more likely to engage with brands and products that offer unique but consistent interfaces across channels and platforms. Traditional sites are rigid, limiting the flexibility required to design and develop engaging experiences.

            “Headless” architecture decouples the front-end from the back-end, which allows you to store your data in one place and then send it across many channels and screens. With this approach, designers and developers are provided the freedom needed to use whatever tools they would like to create for any channel.

            In this talk, we will explore the benefits of leveraging a headless solution including flexibility, personalization, and speed. We will then go over specific use-cases and techniques for building your first headless experience.
