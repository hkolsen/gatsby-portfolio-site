    title: Effective Storytelling with Data Visualization
    description: >-
      Email marketers have more data than ever when it comes to subscribers. That doesn’t mean we’re putting it to work, though. By innovating how we think about data and, more importantly, present that data to subscribers, we can tell effective stories that inspire subscribers to engage with us. In this session, we’ll walk through various datasets and how they can be leveraged through visual design, HTML, and CSS to create more innovative emails for our subscribers.

    title: How to smartly adapt a new framework
    description: >-
      As a developer we tend to want to create from scratch. Part of this reinvention is because of ego and potential praise. The other is just being ignorant about what is already out there. In many respects, there appears to be more prestige for developing something new rather than reusing a sustainable, well-supported system.
