# A simple starter site for Gatsby

This is Gatsby site that leverages Netlify CMS for content editing. It is a great starting point to deploy a small personal site, or a foundation to scale for a project even larger.

## Is this the right project for you?

Before diving in, take a moment to see if the following scenarios apply. If not, it may be best to explore other options that will better fit your needs.

### I am building a site that non-engineers will need to edit content.

This site integrates seamlessly with [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/).

Netlify CMS is an open source content management system for Git workflows. With Github permissions, it will read/write/edit markdown files saved under pages. Anytime an admin user makes changes to a page or section, Netlify CMS will create a new commit with the changes and merge into the master branch in the Github repository. This will then trigger the continuous deployment performed by Netlify.

To add/edit/delete fields in Netlify, navigate to the `config.yml` file under `static/admin` in the project code.

### I will be sharing the codebase with other developers

This project uses [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/), a statically typed superset of JavaScript.

Managing large Javascript codebases can be challenging. This is why more teams are adopting TypeScript, to feel more confident when shipping code. A static type checker does not modify how your code behaves at runtime â€” instead, it analyzes your code and attempts to infer types wherever possible, warning the developer before code ships.

### I am most comfortable using a JavaScript framework, but am concerned about performance and accessibility

This site is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), a static-site generator.

Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build performant websites and apps, while proving out-of-the-box accessible components. Gatsby also allows developers to query data from anywhere via GraphQL.

## If none of the above apply, consider the following:

- **HTML + CSS:** It is difficult to beat the performance of a static HTML and CSS site. Now its even easier to create dynamic layouts easily and accessibly. Check out [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev) for inspiration.
- **[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/):** A simple static-site generator. Plenty of starters and integrates with multiple template languages.

## To get started with this project:

Clone the project to your local development environment:

```
git clone git@github.com:hkolsen/gatsby-portfolio-site.git
```

Run Yarn in the console to install all dependencies:

```
yarn
```

Once complete, run the following to preview locally:

```
yarn start
```

To build the project and serve on your local server:

```
yarn build && yarn serve
```

## Roadmap:

- Light and Dark Mode
- Animations and `prefers-reduced-motion` query
- Move from single-page to multiple-pages
- Screenshot testing
- Build design system
